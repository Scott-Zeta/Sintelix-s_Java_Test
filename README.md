# Sintelix-s_Java_Test

Hello,

It was great meeting you at the University of Adelaide Career Expo!

We thank you for your interest in working with us at Sintelix.

This initial phase of testing is critical to our process, as it enables us to better assess your programming approach and skills, as both are key factors for us when recruiting Software Engineer Interns and Graduates.

The online test consists of 3 questions and you will have 2 weeks to attempt it. You can perform the test in your own time and preferred location. It will likely take around 60 to 90 minutes to complete, if you know your stuff. You may be asked a sample question before the actual test begins. It is recommended that you have an IDE ready before starting.

Please consider your answers carefully. We are looking for CLEAN and EFFICIENT solutions. The final question looks at UI design, please be frank and honest. We're looking for your insights into design.

If your results are favourable, they will be sent to our Senior Engineers for further review, as getting correct answers is only part of our assessment.

Weâ€™re very excited to see what you can do and would like to thank you again for your interest in joining our team!
